TurboDictionary 

TurboDictionary imprements a python dictionary with two additional features.

1. Ability to automatically compress the values. This is useful when you want to store large strings / values.

2. Creating one to many relationships between keys of the dictionary. This effectively makes a dictionary behave like a two column (key, value) table in a relational DB.

The user can specifiy one or both of the features.


Examples:

import Turbo
